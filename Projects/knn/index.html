              This project utilizes C# and supervised learning techniques to identify unique bird songs .
              Supervised learning is the method of using data with a known classification or value to predict
              the value or classification of some unknown data.
              K Nearest Neighbors uses the K most similar known samples to make a conclusion. The primary challenge
              is determining what makes two samples similar.

            WAV files can have any number of these headers, which can determine many attributes of the following audio samples.
            Our files luckily have only one. This means that we simply check the first 44 bytes of the file for formatting information.
            We are concerned with the number of channels (our files are mono-channeled, meaning only one sound source) and bits per sample.
            Our bits per sample is 16, meaning a two-byte signed sample (one-byte samples are unsigned). We read in the file as a byte array
            and add bytes to create samples. Our samples are little-endian, which means we multiply the second byte by ten, as it will be the
            more significant byte within the pair. If we plot the audio sample array for an audio file in excel, we see the following.

            As you can see, this appears very similar to a typical audiograph. Next, we need to find a way to treat the data to improve performance.
            Several strategies were tried, such as normalizing from 0-1, only using loudest samples, but these were unsuccessful. The two
            treatments that had the most significant effect were removing ambient (zero-valued) audio samples, and using only the absolute value of the
            the audio sample to remove negative samples.

            Next, we will select a cross-validation method. Cross-validation is used to ensure that our results will be consistent.
            We will use "leave one out" cross-validation, which takes a random sample from our labelled data and compares it to the remaining 
            labelled data to find our optimal K. Since we will always know the answer, we are able to average the results and safely
            estimate our optimal K. We still need to pick a comparison algorithm; however, this step almost completely determines program flow.

            The best performing algorithm was cross-correlation, which assumes two identical series' are shifted and attempts
            to find how much shifting must be done to sync them. The algorithm is simple to implement, but was 
            tremendously successful with an accuracy of 83%. Several other algorithms were tried, such as Trapezoidal-Rule Integration
            or Kulback-Leibler Divergence, but those did not have the consistent success that cross-correlation could provide.
